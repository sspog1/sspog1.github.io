A good example of this is pleasure gained from the displaying of work on the walls of the learning environment for all to see.

Time Boxing, however, addresses the fact that space and independence may be intimidating for certain learners. Furthermore, it acknowledges the tension between the learner as an individual  and a need to cover a particular amount of content with a group of learners. Where space can be intimidating, direction, constraint and facilitation can be catalysts to creativity and learning.\n"

Investment of effort without confirmation that the correct actions are been taken by the learner are considered a risk. This is because they may result in wasted effort or even worse enforcing an incorrect understanding or application of a skill.\nFeedback can take a number of forms, such as observation and direction from a teacher or the completion of a complete program that can be executed. For example, this could be the time taken to write a hello world program. For Java, the amount of effort investment required from the learner to get the payback or reward of some text being displayed is non-trivial. In a language like Processing, the effort investment made by the learner before observable outcome is much shorter. In Processing and other scripting languages, it is possible to render output in one line of code. This programming effort is considered a risk to a learner, as when they move independently in a direction for a given period time before feedback is offered there is a chance they are moving in the wrong direction. In any learning experience, there will be a cycle of learner effort investment and pay off as the learner works through different tasks and received feedback as they progress.\n"

It is likely that there will be transitions between learners and facilitators as drivers throughout a session.  There can also include a mid-state in which collaboration between the learner and the teacher takes place. For example, a classic higher education style lecture where the lecturer projects content to the learners for a sustained period would be regarded to have very low degree of driver shift. In contrast, a guided practical with a tight cycle, in which learners are shown a brief example and then given space to try it, would be said to have a high degree of driver shift.

The physical environment is an important aspect of a learning experience. Currently as learners progress through nursery school, primary school, secondary school and on to Further and Higher Education, there is a notable shift in learning space design, from a flexible open activity specific space to the increasingly closed transmission-centred lecture theatre design. This correlates with a trend of increasing learner to teacher ratio and a perceived increased â€˜efficiencyâ€™. As learners mature and their attention span increases, the ability to consume and assimilate lectures increases.  However there is a growing consensus [] that active learning is a powerful tool to engage learners and the use and design of learning space must reflect this.
